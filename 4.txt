First, identify the path from $a$ to $e$ with the least distance represented as the sum of the individual distances between nodes. The least distance path has a sum of 12.

Second, identify the edges between nodes that make the path with the least distance, as found in the previous step. Ignore these edges in the subsequent steps.

Third, identify the path with the least distance between nodes $a$ and $e$, ignoring edges as explained before.

Finally, return the distance of the least distance path.
