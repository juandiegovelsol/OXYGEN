First, identify the shortest path by counting the number of edges from the initial to the final node.

Second, consider that the depth value requested must be calculated as the depth where the node can reach the end node g; this is equivalent to providing the depth of the path minus 1.

Finally, provide the result as required using the correct notation. Include the depth in a line and the path in another line, without any LaTeX.
