Step 1: Identify each logical gate by its number positioned below the gate symbol. Document the operation each gate performs (NOT represented with an overline, AND represented with a dot, OR represented with +) and the number of inputs represented with lines on the left of the gate. Create a list but do not determine actual inputs or outputs yet.

Step 2: Trace the signal flow by identifying which input variables (A, B, C) connect to which gate inputs, and which gate outputs serve as inputs to subsequent gates. the variable A has connections to gates 1, 3, and 7, variable C is connected to gates 2 and 3, and Gate 2's output is connected to gates 5 and 7. Follow only the solid connecting lines and note connection points marked with solid dots. Ignore any crossing lines without connection dots.

Step 3: Establish the processing order by identifying which gates can be solved first (gates with only original variables as inputs) and which must wait for intermediate results.

Step 4: Write the boolean expression for each gate's output. Start with gates that depend only on the original variables, and continue with the outputs of gates that depend on the results of other gates. Continue this process until the final output gate is found.

Step 5: Simplify the result to its minimum expression, considering only complementary and associative properties of the Boolean algebra.
