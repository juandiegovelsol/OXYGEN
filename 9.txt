First, create a list for all the nodes, with the edges to other nodes. Note that node 4 is a neighbor of node 3, and node 7 is a neighbor of node 5. This implies that node 7 can
only be reached through node 5 and not the other way around; node 7 IS NOT a neighbor of node 2, the only neighbor of 2 is 6.

Second, compare each node's children's values to find the sequence of nodes produced by the search algorithm. For example, node 2's children must be included before node
4's children, because 2 is lower than 4.

Finally, provide the list of nodes according to the found order.
